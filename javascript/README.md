This example is not working.

I am getting this error.  Development on this stopped in order

XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.1.1/osc/info. 

No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 400.
