Sorry, there is no JavaScript example.

You'll need to use node.js

JavaScript will not work from a browser.

I originally tried to write a browser-based test I realized
that the camera security settings won't allow this.

I am getting this error.  Development on JavaScript stopped in order
to focus on getting more Python examples prior to the hacker event.

XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.1.1/osc/info.

No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 400.
